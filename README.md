The <b>Halkbank DBScript Wizard</b> is a Streamlit application that allows users to upload an Excel file containing column information, select the target database type <b>(MSSQL or DB2)</b>, and specify a schema name. Based on the uploaded data and user selections, the application generates a SQL script. The SQL script includes column definitions along with optional Primary Key (PK) constraints.

The generated scripts are automatically formatted. Options to copy and download the script are available as needed.
